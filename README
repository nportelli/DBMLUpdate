A very simple DBML Update add-in. Fixes all existing tables in a DBML to match what is currently in the database. 
Adds/Removes columns 
Updates existing columns without messing up any properties already set in the DBML file, that aren't related to the
database column (e.g. Access modifiers)

Working on adding the ability to update relationships between tables as well.
